# Stock Price Analysis Tool 

This VBA code was made to help me on my very new path in becoming a programmer and Excel expert.

## Description

I needed to create a script that loops through all the stocks in Excel file for one year and output the following information:

* The ticker symbol

* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image

* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume
